# Helpers
This file is to grow as the app builds.
Each file represents one helper function. This is to minimise the length of code that can suddenly become unmanageable.

Helpers essentially work as small functions that can be reused over and over. Ie - formatting dates.
These are not to be confused with functions for composition API; these will sit in the composables directory.

You can generate a new helper file with:
```
yarn new helper
```
